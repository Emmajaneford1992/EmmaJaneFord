                    <p>Hello I’m Emma! I am an experienced developer with a strong background in augmented reality, game development, and creative front-end web development. With extensive expertise in creating engaging digital experiences, I specialise in both the technical and creative aspects of development.</p>
                    <p>I have a deep understanding of TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My proficiency in Three.js allows me to create visually stunning 3D graphics and interactive experiences for web-based applications. I also have some experience working with React.js and React Three Fibre libraries.  In addition to my web skills, I also have experience in using the game-engine Unity, the 3D software Blender & Maya and the creative tools Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
                    <p>From 2018 to 2024, I worked as an AR Developer at Zappar, where I created augmented and mixed reality experiences using Zappar's tools like ZapWorks Studio, Mattercraft, and their Universal AR SDK.  I developed and maintained code for commercial projects for high-profile clients such as Legoland, Rovio, Disney, 7-Eleven, Paramount, Lunchables, Nestle, Universal, DFDS, Michelob, Britvic, Pez, Sharpie, Kellogg’s and H&M.</p>

                    <p>While at Zappar I have been a part of developing many different and unique experiences such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interactive photo-features, using face-tracking tools that recognises key landmarks on a user’s face.</li>
                        <li>World tracking for AR experiences enabling users to accurately place digital content within the physical environment for immersive user experiences.</li>
                        <li>Game experiences such as slide-puzzles, card matching, tower defence, dot-to-dot, ball sports, endless runner, colouring, quiz, a time-related farming game and a game where a character is built from parts.</li>
                        <li>Informational experiences, used for advertising and explaining real world products in detail.</li>
                        <li>Treasure hunt experiences that use of multiple QR codes placed around the real world.</li>
                        <li>Image tracked experiences, tracking content to posters, business cards, or packaging such as bottles, cereal packs and even a van.</li>
                        <li>Portal experiences where a digital doorway is created that allows users to step into an alternate reality or environment through the use of augmented reality technology.</li>
                        <li>Accessible experiences, I have worked on a project for the visually impaired, ensuring that the experience is read aloud and describes the website efficiently while the VoiceOver accessibility feature is in use.</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>While at Zappar I’ve developed strong team collaboration skills through close collaboration with producers, designers, and 3D animators. Together, we've approached projects with clear, open communication, continuously adapting our work based on both receiving and giving feedback to achieve a successful outcome. Additionally, I have experience working closely with other developers using GIT to collaborate and for version control management. I also worked alongside the QA team debugging and troubleshooting AR experiences during development. This involved testing multiple platforms including iOS and android mobile devices to identify and fix bugs, checking for responsiveness and ensuring optimal gameplay experiences. In the early stages of a project I have worked with colleagues to idealise games, contributing to the conceptualisation of game concepts, and translating ideas into prototypes. Working with others has enhanced my understanding of teamwork and its role in achieving collective success.</p>

                    <p>I have acquired proficiency in integrating Google Analytics 4 tools to track user engagement, honed my problem-solving and debugging skills, and gained experience in localisation projects to ensure seamless translations for international users. Additionally, I have expertise in integrating music and sound to create an immersive atmosphere. I also possess the ability to tailor experiences based on target audiences, having worked on projects targeted for children, adults, and individuals with visual impairments, ensuring each experience has reflected the user’s unique needs.</p>

                    <p>Before joining Zappar, I worked as an Indie Unity Developer. During this time, I created a mobile puzzle game with multiple levels, handling all aspects of game development, from programming to designing user interfaces, creating 3D characters, utilising the Unity Facebook API, and releasing the game on the Google App Store.</p>
                    <p>At Staffordshire University, I pursued a degree in Animation, achieving a 2.1. Throughout my academic journey, I acquired a versatile set of 3D generalist skills. This included proficiency in 3D modelling, where I mastered the creation of detailed and accurate models using industry-standard software such as Blender and Maya. I also delved into texturing techniques, learning to apply textures and materials to enhance visual appeal and realism. Rigging and animation became another area of expertise, allowing me to bring characters and objects to life through smooth and lifelike movements. Additionally, I developed skills in rendering techniques to produce high-quality images and animations. Compositing skills were also developed, enabling me to seamlessly integrate various elements into final projects. Lastly, I explored lighting techniques to manipulate light and shadow, enhancing the mood and depth of my animated scenes. While my role has evolved, the skills I gained as an animator are invaluable as a creative developer, enabling me to enhance user experiences and develop visually engaging projects.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I love going out and socialising at the pub, enjoying karaoke nights with friends. However, I also find joy in cozying up at home with a good movie, TV series, or book. Playing board and card games with friends is another favourite activity of mine. I love music, and I'm currently trying to learn how to play guitar. Additionally, I spend a lot of time doing DIY house projects, which allows me to express my creativity and improve my home. To relax and unwind, I love going on beach holidays abroad, soaking up the sun, and enjoying long walks in nature. I also find pleasure in cooking for my partner, family, and friends, and ocassionley ending the day with a glass of wine, embracing life's simple pleasures.</p>
                    <p>I’m excited to continue this journey, turning ideas into reality and creating memorable digital experiences. If you want to connect or have any job opportunities you think I may be interested in please feel free to contact me.</p>
