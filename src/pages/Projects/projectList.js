It was designed to complement a range of products featuring classic and much-loved Disney properties. I developed three mini-games within the Disney Kitchen experience ",
        description2: "First, the Disney Star-to-Star game, which is a twist on the traditional ‘dot-to-dot’ game. The user's device gyroscope is used to keep the space scene in place, the players can then move their phone around the the 360 environment as well as drag the wand around the screen to join the stars together, once they have joined all of the stars together, a Disney Princess is revealed.  Elements are also layered in the 360 space scene to give a parallax effect.",
        description3: "The Marvel ‘Point-to-Point' game was very similar to the Disney Princess ’Star to Star’. The game mechanics were copied, but the background was swapped out and each new Marvel character was traced to make sure the dots & lines were in the correct place to form each unique character.",
        description4: "I also developed the ‘Colouring with Cars’ mini-game. This is an AR colouring activity using world tracking to place the scene from cars in the user's real-world space. After the player has placed the scene they can pick from dozens of Cars characters to colour in, they simply choose a colour from the bottom menu and tap on a section of the image to colour. Once they are happy with their creation they can save the image to their device. To create the colouring functionality I used typescript & Three.js. Once I had determined which section of the SVG the user had clicked on I changed the colour. I also added an undo button so that the players could revert back to the previous state if they weren’t happy with their most recent change.",

        description2: "The power of connected packaging was highlighted in this gamified AR experience. This on-pack campaign covering 30+ markets centred on the new Lion King movie and coincided with its release. Instead of unsustainable plastic toys in the cereal box, customers scanned the back of the pack to enjoy three different educational puzzles and mini activities as well as exciting video clips from the upcoming movie.",
        description3: "Utilising Zappar’s AR technology I developed the home page & all three mini activities for this experience. The player can swipe through an interactive carousel to select an activity or select the trailer button to watch the trailer for the new movie. Once selected all three mini-games also have a brief animated demonstration to help the player learn the game. Prompts, demonstrations, and tutorials can be vital to ensure the player knows how to navigate the experience as intended.",
        description4: "The first game is a slide puzzle, using the image of Simba from The Lion King. To create this game the image was split into nine tiles (3 by 3). The ninth bottom right tile was removed to create an empty space. The tiles were then reorganised and put in a random position on the grid. To play the game the player could use the empty space to drag the tiles and reposition them into the correct order. There is also an added pressure of a timer, the quicker the game is complete the more stars the player would get. Using the player’s device's gyroscope rotation I also added a subtle parallax effect between the slide puzzle and the game background. Even making the game slightly responsive to the user's device rotation can really add to the experience making it feel more interactive to the user.",
        description5: "The second puzzle game I developed was the match game. The player is presented with multiple faced-down cards. When the player selects a card the card flips revealing a Lion King movie-related image. If two selected card images are a matching pair the cards remain upwards if they don’t match they flip back. The user must find all the matching pairs to complete the game. This is a memory-based game, the quicker the player can remember where all of the images are, the quicker they can complete the game. Similar to the slide puzzle the matching pair game also has the added pressure of a timer. The faster the game is completed the more stars the player will receive.",
        description6: "The third game is a twist on the traditional ‘dot-to-dot’ game. The device's gyroscope is used to keep the sky scene in place, the players can then either move their phone around the 360 environment or drag the pencil around the screen to join the stars together, once they have joined all of the stars together, an image of Simba is revealed. Similar to the other two games this game also has a timer.",

Using an animated hand prompt the player is then encouraged to plant a seed in their pot, to grow their plant the user must then use the rain-drop button which generates rain that can water the plant. Other functionality includes the camera button so the player can take and share pictures of their plant growing progress and the day/night button, if night the scene is darkened and a glow effect is added to the plant and rain.",
        description4: "This game is a time-based strategy game after the player has watered the plant the timer is revealed at the top of the screen. The user must come back after the time is complete to see the evolution of their plant growing and to continue caring for it. Because it was unlikely that the user would keep their app open during the timer’s countdown I used the player's device storage to store the time they had last watered their plant. So if the player did exit and re-enter the app I could work out whether the timer had already been completed or if I needed to update the timer with the new countdown.",
        description5: "For this project, I worked alongside the 3D team who created a different plant for each different stage of the plant's evolution. As well as animating the plant they also used blend-shapes to open and close the plant. This was a nice feature added so the player could interact with the plant, when they clicked on the plant it would open/close and when they swiped the screen the plant would respond by animating side to side. I utilised Three.js to import the GLTF, animate from frame to frame, as well as morph between the blend shapes. Using Three.js I could add lighting and a shadow plane so the plant pot could cast and retrieve shadows. To make it look more photorealistic.",

The experience utilised many of Zappar’s AR technology to create many interactive content and reward 7-Eleven customers with points, that they could redeem in 7-Eleven stores for free snacks and goodies. I was thrilled to work on two mini-activities with Zappar early on in my career there I developed a Doritos photo-feature experience and a Dr-Pepper basketball game where players would throw their basketballs at the Dr Pepper can target.",

With the help of our Zappar Creative Studio team, 'Egg Attack' was born - a web-app-based AR experience featuring a host of face and world-tracked games, bringing more fun to the Burger King experience, and more visibility for our furious feathered friends.",
        description2: "This game is a twist on traditional tower defence game, the aim of the game is for the user to protect the pile of Eggs from Attack, hence the game's name ‘Egg Attack’. After placing the content in world space and starting the game the player's goal is to quick-tap the hatchling to try to prevent them from reaching the eggs. There is also a slingshot that propels slime, if the hatchling gets caught up in the slime it slows down its speed giving the player an advantage. I enjoyed developing this fun and exciting game.",

This experience was created using Three.js and other web-based languages such as Typescript, HTML & CSS. The player is presented with a swipeable infinite carousel of many Disney Characters to choose from. Once selected the player can interact with the image and colour it in using the many available colours. As well as colouring in I also added undo, delete, and zoom in & out functionalities. The player can return to the menu at any point to select a different Disney-themed image to colour in. I also added a tutorial section, so if stuck the player would have help with navigating the experience.",
